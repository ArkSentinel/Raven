/**
 * Raven
 * raven_text_editor.h : multi-line text editor, and the languages it knows.
 *
 * R_WIDGET_TEXT_EDITOR edits a text of any number of lines: selection with
 * the mouse and the keyboard, clipboard, undo and redo, line numbers, word
 * wrap. It scrolls by itself. In XML:
 *
 *     <TextEditor Name="notes" Wrap="true" Placeholder="Write here"/>
 *     <TextEditor Language="Rust" LineNumbers="true" Slot.Fill="1"/>
 *
 * Given a language, the editor colors the text, proposes words while typing
 * (the words of the language and the names already written in the text),
 * shows which bracket closes which, indents after an opening bracket, closes
 * brackets and quotes, and comments lines out. C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript,
 * TypeScript, Python, Rust, GLSL, JSON, CSS, XML and HTML are built in; any
 * of them can be changed, and others declared, with Rlanguage_register.
 *
 * This is what the editor knows from the text alone. What needs to
 * understand a whole program (the type of an expression, the errors of a
 * compiler) comes from outside, through two doors: a completion callback
 * that adds its own proposals, and markers that underline a part of the text
 * with a message.
 *
 * Positions are a line and a column, both starting at 0; a column is a byte
 * offset in the UTF-8 text of its line. Out-of-range positions are clamped.
 *
 * Keys: arrows, Home / End, Page Up / Down, with Ctrl to move by word or to
 * the ends of the text and with Shift to select; Ctrl+A, C, X, V; Ctrl+Z,
 * Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z; Tab and Shift+Tab indent the selected lines;
 * Ctrl+Space proposes words; Ctrl+/ comments the selected lines out.
 * A double click selects a word, a triple click a line.
